# Clean Coding

# 1. Use meaningful variable and function names that describe their purpose.
# 2. Keep functions and classes small and focused on a single task.
# 3. Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle by avoiding code duplication.
# 4. Write comments that explain why you're doing something, not what you're doing.
# 5. Use docstrings to document classes and functions.
# 6. Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes that reflect their purpose.
# 7. Use whitespace to improve readability and separate logical blocks of code.
# 8. Use consistent naming conventions for variables, functions, and classes.
# 9. Use Python's built-in data types and functions whenever possible.
# 10. Use list comprehensions or generator expressions instead of for loops when appropriate.
# 11. Use default argument values instead of None to avoid confusion.
# 12. Use error handling to catch and handle exceptions.
# 13. Avoid using global variables when possible.
# 14. Use object-oriented programming principles to encapsulate data and behavior.
# 15. Use modules and packages to organize your code into logical units.
# 16. Write unit tests to verify the correctness of your code.
# 17. Use pylint or flake8 to check your code for errors and adherence to coding standards.
# 18. Use logging to record events and errors in your code.
# 19. Use the contextlib module to manage resources and ensure their proper cleanup.
# 20. Use Python's standard library whenever possible to avoid reinventing the wheel.

# DRY principle - 

# The DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle in Python coding emphasizes the avoidance of code duplication by promoting code reuse, modularity, and abstraction, resulting in more concise, efficient, and maintainable code.
