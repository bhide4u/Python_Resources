# Code Formatting PEP8

# PEP 8 is the official style guide for Python code, and it provides guidelines on how to format your Python code to enhance readability and maintainability. 
# Consistently following PEP 8 recommendations helps improve code quality and makes it easier for others to understand and collaborate on your code.

# Here are some key aspects of code formatting according to PEP 8:

# 1. Indentation: Use 4 spaces for indentation. Avoid using tabs.

# 2. Line Length: Limit lines to a maximum of 79 characters. For long lines, you can use parentheses for line continuation.

# 3. Blank Lines: Use blank lines to separate logical sections of code and functions or class definitions. Use two blank lines between top-level functions and classes.

# 4. Imports: Import statements should be on separate lines, and each import should be on a separate line. Group imports into three sections: standard library imports, third-party library imports, and local application imports. Within each section, sort the imports alphabetically.

# 5. Whitespace: Use a single space around operators and after commas, colons, and semicolons. Avoid extraneous whitespace.

# 6. Naming Conventions: Use lowercase letters and underscores for variable and function names. Use CapitalizedWords or CamelCase for class names. Use all uppercase letters for constants.

# 7. Comments: Use comments to explain non-obvious code and document your code. Comments should have a space after the `#` character.

# 8. Function and Class Definitions: Use two blank lines before a function or class definition. Put a space after the colon in function and class definitions.

# 9. String Quotes: Use single quotes (`'`) for short strings and double quotes (`"`) for longer strings or strings that contain single quotes.

# 10. Docstrings: Use docstrings to provide documentation for functions, classes, and modules. Docstrings should be enclosed in triple quotes and follow specific formatting conventions outlined in PEP 257.

# These are just some of the key guidelines mentioned in PEP 8. It is recommended to read the full PEP 8 style guide for a comprehensive understanding of the formatting conventions.

# To help adhere to PEP 8, you can use automated tools like linters (e.g., Flake8, pylint) and code formatters (e.g., Black) that can automatically check and enforce PEP 8 compliance in your codebase.

# By following PEP 8 guidelines, you contribute to writing clean, readable, and consistent Python code that is easier to understand, maintain, and collaborate on with other developers.
