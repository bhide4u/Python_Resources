# Escape Sequences

# In Python, an escape sequence is a combination of characters that represents a special character or sequence of characters. Escape sequences are commonly used to represent characters that cannot be directly entered into a string or to add special formatting to output.

# Here are some of the most commonly used escape sequences in Python:

# \n - newline character, inserts a line break.

# \t - tab character, inserts a horizontal tab.

# \' - single quote character, allows a single quote to be included in a string that is delimited by single quotes.

# \" - double quote character, allows a double quote to be included in a string that is delimited by double quotes.

# \\ - backslash character, allows a backslash to be included in a string.

# Here are some examples of using escape sequences in Python:

# using newline and tab characters
print("First line\nSecond line")
print("Column 1\tColumn 2\tColumn 3")

# using single and double quotes
print('He said, "Hello World!"')
print("She's a Python programmer.")

# using backslash
print("C:\\Users\\John\\Documents")
