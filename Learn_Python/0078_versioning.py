# Versioning

# Versioning is a common practice in software development that involves assigning unique identifiers to software releases. These identifiers, known as version numbers, help track and communicate changes, updates, and compatibility of the software over time. The specific convention for version numbers can vary depending on the software development methodology and the project's chosen approach. However, the general convention typically follows a standard format, such as `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

# 1. MAJOR Version: The MAJOR version indicates significant updates or changes that may introduce backward-incompatible features or major enhancements. When the MAJOR version number changes, it often indicates that the software has undergone substantial changes, and users should pay attention to potential compatibility issues when upgrading.

# 2. MINOR Version: The MINOR version represents incremental updates, new features, or enhancements that maintain backward compatibility with previous releases. Changes in the MINOR version usually indicate added functionality or improvements without introducing major disruptions to existing code.

# 3. PATCH Version: The PATCH version is used for bug fixes, patches, or minor updates that address issues or provide small improvements. These updates typically do not introduce new features or alter existing functionality significantly.

# Apart from these three components, some versioning systems may include additional identifiers, such as pre-release or build metadata, to provide more granular information about the software.

# Here's an example to illustrate versioning:
# Consider a software library named "example-lib" with an initial release version of `1.0.0`. Suppose the development team makes the following changes:

# - They add new features and enhance existing functionality without breaking backward compatibility. This results in a new release of `1.1.0`.
# - They discover and fix some bugs in the library. This leads to a patch release of `1.1.1`.
# - They introduce a major change that modifies the API and requires code changes in dependent projects. This warrants a MAJOR version update to `2.0.0`.

# The version numbers `1.1.0` and `1.1.1` indicate minor updates and bug fixes within the `1.x.x` series, while the version number `2.0.0` signifies a significant change that may require careful consideration when upgrading.

# Adhering to a versioning convention helps developers and users understand the nature of changes introduced in a software release, assess compatibility with existing codebases, and manage dependencies effectively. It enables effective communication and ensures that users can make informed decisions about adopting new versions of the software.
