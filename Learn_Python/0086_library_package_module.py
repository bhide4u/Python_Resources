# Library, Package and Module

# In Python, the terms "library," "package," and "module" refer to different concepts related to organizing and reusing code. Here's an explanation of each term, along with their corresponding folder structure:

# 1. Module:
#    A module is a single file containing Python code that defines functions, classes, variables, or other objects. It is the smallest unit of reusable code in Python.

#    Folder Structure:
   
   '''
   project/
   └── module.py
   '''

#    In the example above, 'module.py' represents a module file. You can import and use the objects defined in this module in other Python scripts.

# 2. Package:
#    A package is a way to organize related modules into a directory hierarchy. It contains an '__init__.py' file that identifies the directory as a package and can also include additional module files or sub-packages.

#    Folder Structure:
   
   '''
   project/
   └── package/
       ├── __init__.py
       └── module1.py
   '''

#    In this structure, 'package' is a package directory that contains an '__init__.py' file. It may also include other module files like 'module1.py'. The '__init__.py' file can contain initialization code for the package or act as a placeholder if no initialization is needed.

# 3. Library:
#    A library, also known as a module library or package library, is a collection of packages, modules, or both, organized in a structured way to provide functionality for specific tasks or domains. Libraries often consist of multiple packages, each containing related modules.

#    Folder Structure:
   
   '''
   project/
   ├── library/
   │   ├── package1/
   │   │   ├── __init__.py
   │   │   └── module1.py
   │   └── package2/
   │       ├── __init__.py
   │       └── module2.py
   └── main.py
   '''

#    In this structure, 'library' is the library directory that contains multiple packages ('package1' and 'package2'). Each package can have its own set of modules. The 'main.py' file in the root folder can import and use the packages and modules from the library.

#    Libraries are often distributed and shared for reuse in various projects, providing a collection of functionalities for specific purposes.

# Note: The '__init__.py' files inside packages are required to make them importable as packages. These files can be empty or contain initialization code specific to the package.

# By organizing code into modules, packages, and libraries, Python provides a flexible way to structure and reuse code, promoting modularity, maintainability, and code organization in larger projects.
