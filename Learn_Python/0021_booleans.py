# Booleans
# In Python, a boolean is a data type that has two possible values: True and False. 
# Booleans are used to represent truth values or logical values
# Booleans are often used in conditional statements to determine the flow of a program based on whether a condition is true or false

# Booleans can be combined using logical operators such as and, or, and not to create more complex boolean expressions.

# Boolean expressions can be evaluated to True or False using comparison operators such as 

# == (equal to), 
# != (not equal to), 
# < (less than), 
# > (greater than), 
# <= (less than or equal to)
# >= (greater than or equal to).
