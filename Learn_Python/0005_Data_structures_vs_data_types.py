# Difference between Data Types and Data Structures - 

# Data types and data structures are both fundamental concepts in computer programming, but they are distinct from each other.

# In Python, a data type is a classification of data that determines the type of operations that can be performed on it. Python has several built-in data types such as integers, floats, strings, and booleans. Each data type has its own set of operations that can be performed on it. For example, arithmetic operations can be performed on integer and float data types, but not on string data types.

# On the other hand, a data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and used efficiently. Python provides several built-in data structures such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. Each data structure has its own set of methods and operations that can be performed on it. For example, the append() method can be used to add an element to the end of a list, and the keys() method can be used to retrieve all the keys in a dictionary.

# In summary, while data types determine the type of data that can be stored and the operations that can be performed on them, data structures are a way of organizing and storing data to make it more efficient to access and use.
