commenting - 
single line, multi line

variables - 

variable declaration rules - 
1. Descriptive names, easy to read
2. Avoid reserved keywords as variable names
3. Use lowercase letters, separate words by underscore, snake_case
4. Declare variables close to where they are used.
5. Define constants in all capital letters
6. Don't reuse variables in same block of code
7. Avoid using global variables unless absolutely necessary
8. use variable type annotations eg. - num_students: int = 20

Special variables / Magic variables
1. _ Used as a placeholder for variables that are not used in the code
2. __ Used for name mangling in Python classes (Name mangling is a technique that makes a variable or method private to a class)
3. __init__  Double underscore on both sides - Used for special methods or attributes in Python

Variable assignments - 

1. Multiple values to multiple variables
a, b, c = 1, 2, 3

2. One value to multiple variables
a = b = c = "apple"

Unpacking collection - 
a, b, c = [1, 2, 3]

Variable Scoping - 
1. Global 
- defined outside of any function or class definition
- can be accessed from anywhere in your code
- to modify a global variable from within a function, you need to use the global keyword (not recommended)

2. Local 
- Defined within a function or class definition
- they can only be accessed from within that function or class


Data structure vs Data Type - 

Data Type - 
- A data type is a classification of data that determines the type of operations that can be performed on it
- integers, floats, strings, and booleans
- Each data type has its own set of operations that can be performed on it

Data Structures -
- a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and used efficiently
- builtin data structures - lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets
- Each data structure has its own set of methods and operations that can be performed on it
- eg -  append() method on lists , keys() method on dictionaries

Data types in Python - 

1. Numeric Types - int, float, complex
2. Text Type - str
3. Sequence Types - list, tuple, range
4. Mapping Type - dict
5. Set Types - set, frozenset
6. Boolean Type - bool
7. Binary Types - bytes, bytearray, memoryview
8. None Type - None

Specialized Data types in Python - 
1. lists

2. strings
- '' or ""
- display using print()
- Multiline Strings - ''' or """
- strings are arrays
- square brackets to access elements of string [] (first character has index 0)
- string concatenation - + 
- formatted strings - f"{}" , {pi:.2f}, "{}".format() , can specify {:.2f} in .format() 

- escape sequences - \n, \t, \', \", \\, 

Operators
1. Arithmetic - addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, floor division, exponentiation
- Operator Precedence - the order in which operations are evaluated in an expression

2. Assignment - addition and assignment, subtraction and assignment, multiplication and assignment, division and assignment, modulo and assignment

3. Comparison - equal to, not equal to, greater than, less than, greater than equal to, less than equal to

4. Logical operators - AND, OR, NOT

Expression vs Statement -  
Expression - piece of code that produces a value
Statement - complete unit of execution that performs an action
Statement (cannot be part of an expression) <= Expression (Can be part of a statement or stand alone)

Type conversion 
int()
float()
string()

must know functions - 
1. print()
2. type(variable)

Builtin modules
1. random - radint, radrange (methods)
2. Math - abs, round, pow, sqrt, floor, ceil, min, max, sum, log
